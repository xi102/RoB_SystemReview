introduction h ypertension one common clinical disorders world 
approximately billion indi viduals worldwide affected hypertension united states nearly third adult population hypertensive prevalence hypertension increases age 
lifetime risk hypertension middle aged adults approaches united states many patients known cardiovascular disease hypertensive experienced stroke accounted approximately million deaths estimated direct indirect cost hypertension billion 
suggested individuals blood pressure bp levels greater mmhg systolic diastolic blood pressure sbp dbp consider complementary methods help de crease blood pressure clinically appropriate search therapy offers minimal adverse effects need targeted approaches directed lying mechanisms hypertension 
although western medical science developed many treatment strategies control hypertension antihypertensive medical therapies perfect often associated adverse effects 
regard drug therapy indiscriminately blocks many ceptors leading unwanted responses including serious injuries associated falls older patients therefore imperative identify effective approaches achieve optimal control hypertension 
adverse effects currently available therapy control hypertension sparked growing interest alternative medical treatments acupuncture however de spite increasing worldwide interest complementary medical therapy including acupuncture many western physicians reluctant recommend medical mo dality ef cacy treatment hypertension remains controversial physiologic mechanisms account hypotensive actions clear several studies evaluated bp lowering actions acupuncture patients hypertension ndings inconclusive researchers suggested acupuncture decrease elevated blood pressure others concluded little effect prior acupuncture studies weaknesses 
example sample sizes small calculated priori randomization rare many studies lacked ade quate control groups using acupoints serve ef fective controls follow period treatment generally nonexistent inadequate 
studies relied traditional chinese medicine tcm theory involving meridian qi hypotheses apply stimulation rather applying modern scienti c principles guide acupuncture therapy practice tcm depends history physical examination classify patients guide selection acupoints ultimately leading selection different acupoints individual patients hence standardized approaches select acupoints stimulation used tcm based studies 
acupuncturists using tcm usually stimulate several acupoints acupoints minimal input cardiovascular centers brain fur thermore patients many studies receiving antihy pertensive medications trial design addresses added value acupuncture lead variable results patients change medication dosing clinical trial 
additionally studies relied termittent cuff bp measurements rather ambulatory monitoring 
intermittent cuff measurements introduce observer bias ect bp throughout day 
thus rigorous properly designed clinical trials evaluate uence acupuncture hypertension required
