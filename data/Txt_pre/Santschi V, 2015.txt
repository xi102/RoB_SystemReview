bmc cardiovascular disorders page background high blood pressure bp major risk factor cardiovascular diseases cvd mortality worldwide 
although treatment hypertension substan tially reduce risk hypertension remains dected undertreated poorly controlled 
example half north american treated patients hypertension remain uncontrolled 
furthermore due ageing populations busy clinical workloads shortage physicians healthcare systems new approaches hypertension care involving pharmacists nurses could promising approach improve bp management control 
pharmacists highly accessible healthcare profes sionals indeed valuable asset improve hyperten sion management providing medication management collaboration physicians supporting patients medication intake 
evidence supports pharmacists working alone teams ef fective management hypertension cvd risk factors 
nurses pro viding lifestyle counseling health education also helpful management chronic diseases including hypertension 
valuable member team based care interface patients physicians 
furthermore nurses also intervene collaboration pharmacists improve bp shown canadian study community based prevention programs canada usa 
demonstrated collaborative model involving community pharmacists primary care physicians focused management drug adherence feasible swiss healthcare system improved long term bp control among uncontrolled hypertensive patients 
team based care coordinated model care involving different healthcare professionals phy sicians pharmacists nurses non physician clinicians working collaborative partnership expertise

discussion tbc hta randomized controlled study ongoing first attempt evaluate new approach focused team based care intervention engaging different healthcare professionals improve bp control primary care setting switzerland 
results current study complete knowledge team based care approach also inform policymakers implementable strategies future 
indeed study could make significant contribution various health care systems terms efficacy possible implemen tation dissemination collaborative approach hypertension management 
addition ambulatory clinics selected interested implementing tbc interprofessional intervention clinical practice 
however fact study conducted real life conditions existing community healthcare professional resources increases generalizability possibility disseminating intervention effective primary care settings 
value study could enhanced economic analysis integrating estimate patient contact time nurses community pharmacists physicians 
analysis could offer policy makers compelling arguments dissemination tbc intervention 
therefore secondary exploratory analyses make estimations cost intervention 
although swiss healthcare system character istics may hidden generalizability findings results combined similar studies provide impetus gradual dissemination tbc model settings countries high burden hypertension shortage physicians 
strengths tbc hta study include design rct use existing community healthcare professional resources real life conditions evaluate collaborative approach 
addition tbc model hypertension care could offer opportunities efficient approach hypertension treatment control real life conditions inform policy makers strategies implement
