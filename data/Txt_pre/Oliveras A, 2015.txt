studies compared rdn sham procedure treat patients resistant hyper tension trials compared rdn versus adjusted antihypertensive drug treatment 
taking together shown recent meta analysis although studies suggested rdn superior appro priate pharmacological strategy becomes necessary fur ther confirmation high heterogeneity among study populations 
regards role spironolactone treatment patients resistant hypertension recently published results pathway trial shown addition spironolactone mg far effective reduce home sbp addition placebo bisoprolol doxazosin patients resistant hypertension 
otherwise trials mentioned comparing rdn intensified pharmacological treatment permitted prespeci fied inclusion spironolactone part antihypertensive schedule pharmacological group treatment 
however none planned head head comparison rdn versus spironolactone exclusive add therapy 
therefore designed denervhta study determine group differ ences changes h sbp patients randomized receive rdn addition spironolactone anti hypertensive drug treatment scheduled time 
knowledge first randomized clinical trial compares head head two different concrete treatments added previous antihypertensive drug regimen addition single drug spironolactone addition device based treatment rdn 
furthermore h bp considered reliable way measure bp therefore planned evaluate changes h sbp primary endpoint 
results clearly favoured addition spironolactone baseline antihyper tensive treatment facing challenge reducing high bp achieving bp control patients resistant hypertension 
several factors may justify higher bp reduction spironolactone group 
main reason may study therapeutic algorithm table 
mean baseline adjusted changes renal function parameters months renal denervation n spironolactone n variable serum creatinine mmol l egfr ml min per serum potassium mmol l change months mean ci change months mean ci ci confidence intervals egfr estimated glomerular filtration rate rdn renal denervation 
mean baseline adjusted difference ci two groups months spironolactone versus rdn p www jhypertension com volume number september spironolactone group forced titration mg whenever possible 
higher dose used aforemen tioned studies predefined dosage mg 
fact important role spironolactone achieve bp control patients difficult treat resistant hyper tension increasingly acknowledged 
previously referred pathway trial almost patients achieved bp control receiving spironolac tone percentage close found study 
according protocol denervhta trial secondary causes hypertension including primary aldos teronism ruled appropriate studies 
ever admitted many patients resistant hypertension aldosterone excess dysregulation either hormone epithelial sodium channel even modestly elevated nearly normal levels aldoster one believed inappropriately high likely contribute volume overload state 
way previously shown trials addition spironolactone reduced office sbp mmhg patients resistant hypertension irre spective whether primary aldosteronism 
denervhta study found decrease around mmhg office sbp quite similar bp reduction 
believe unlikely undetected primary aldosteronism reason higher bp decrease spironolactone group 
regards rdn procedures carried interventionalist avoid intercentre intracentre variability 
operator received appropriate training treatment acquired skills performed several procedures initiating trial 
observed changes h sbp successively denervated patients study supplementary material figure http links lww com hjh makes unlikely operating learning curve affects success rdn procedures line analysed results symplicity htn trial 
unfortunately reliable perioperative marker successful rdn exists 
even though number ablations failed predict bp response rdn leading trials median number shots study considered within range better decreasing bp results 
decreases office h sbp also quite similar achieved trials 
note differences groups regarding decreases office bp values reach statistical significance 
appears white coat phenomena specially highly prevalent patients resistant hyper tension showing reduction office bp values parallel h bp decrease 
line results three open rdn trials indicate white coat effect must drop mmhg baseline final examination implying alerting response almost completely dis appears suggesting effect could mediated renal nerves 
could least partly explain favourable results rdn observed first studies symplicity htn htn main data referred office bp 
authors also reported effect abp monitoring patients pseudoresistant hypertension whereas reduction office bp similar extent patients spironolactone versus renal denervation true resistant hypertension observed 
attending secondary endpoints found decrease mmhg night time sbp rdn group significantly different aldosterone group 
pointed rdn appears unmask white coat phenomena patients resistant hyperten sion 
accordingly partial component true resistant hypertension patients could reflected relatively higher drop night time bp 
suggested occur symplicity htn trial could also explanation results regards night time bp reduction 
one potential limitation relatively small size denervhta study cohort 
however publication results symplicity htn trial observation trial spironolactone appeared superior rdn decreasing bp led perform corresponding interim analyses subsequently stop inclusion patients 
post hoc power sample size calculation current number enrolled patients shows considering difference h sbp lowering mmhg bilateral error statistical power average sd mmhg 
must acknowledge risk patients low gfr high baseline serum potassium excluded study limits advantage sprinolactone group patients certain clinical features 
anyway must remark results checked months thereafter interest closely follow renal function serum potassium levels cannot discard possible adverse results neither possibility poor long term adherence spirono lactone 
another possible limitation cannot strictly ensure therapeutic adherence even testing hay nes sackett test enter study 
however believe limitation largely offset strict bp inclusion criteria beyond precise definition resistant hyper tension 
strength trial patients main tained baseline antihypertensive drug regimen least months prior enrol study consequently ensur ing true resistance pharmacological treatment 
finally results cannot extrapolated clinical settings patients mild hypertension worse renal function generalizable rdn catheters devices mineralocorticoid receptor blockers 
conclusion found patients true resistant hypertension addition mg daily spironolactone effective rdn reduce h sbp dbp months 
light results believe spironolactone considered fourth antihypertensive drug prescribe deemed well tolerated patients diagnosed true resistant hypertension even though mandatory closely monitoring renal function patients carefully uptitrate drug
