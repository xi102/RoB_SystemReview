month treatment daily mg spironolactone associated significant reduc tion office sbpm high likelihood reaching recommended target blood pressure without significant change serum sodium concentrations mild elevation serum potassium levels 
individual variation serum creatinine intervention compared alternative drug regimen group spironolactone group exhibited significant reduction bp 
achieved reduction mean office bp mmhg higher mmhg reported hase et al 
treating dm japanese patients weeks similar dose spironolactone 
pronounced renal impairment popu lation could account least part difference 
differing durations follow also another possi ble reason would suggest perhaps following cohort beyond weeks could reveal attenu ation effect spironolactone time 
note however hase et al study bp reduc tion still significant years introduction spironolactone 
also reported significant reduction office ambulatory bp fixed daily dose mg spironolactone dm danish patients weeks therapy 
results together suggest possible effectiveness small dose spironolactone people diabetes unlike general population non diabetic ckd patients higher doses often needed overcome resistant hypertension 
unlike participants alternative drug regimen group spironolactone group reached target office bp mmhg recommended idf exception one patient reached target diastolic systolic bp 
patients receiving spironolactone reached target bp 
although continuing debate target value bp dm patients claims goal mmhg less realistic older populations like mean age years target associated reduced overall cardiovascular mortality dm patients still seems achievable 
recent studies animals humans reported spironolactone produces many metabolic benefits preventing dyslipidemia cardiovascular effects dm beside known diuretic properties 
reduces vascular stiffness mediates vasodilation increasing nitric oxide bioavailabil ity inhibiting sympathetic system 
last effects likely pronounced resistant hypertension translate reduced pulse wave velocity systolic bp 
possi bly explain pronounced action systolic bp observed study 
alongside effects spironolactone many beneficial effects diabetic patients 
particular improves endothelial function exerts antithrombogenic effects blocking aldosterone thereby mediating antithrombotic effects 
furthermore reduces risk inflammatory cerebral myocardial renal injury associ ated reduced prevalence arrhythmia heart failure sudden death post myocardial infarction mortality 
considering actions spirono lactone perhaps conceived anymore simple antihypertensive drug also cardiopro tective nephroprotective drug suitable diabetic patients absence contraindications 
spironolactone probably place among first line antihypertensive drugs diabetic patients regard less whether resistant hypertension 
indeed aldosterone escape phenomenon characterized initial partially reversible decrease aldosterone well known use acei djoumessi et al 
bmc res notes page agents makes aldosterone specific blockers spironolactone effective 
also proved low dose spironolactone used alone effective spironolactone losartan combination improving diabetic nephropathy 
arguments corroborate fact abso lute necessity combine spironolactone medi ates better results desired effects acei arb drugs 
associations even recommended since increase risk adverse drug reactions including hyperkalemia 
despite safe dosage spironolactone used study observed mild increase mean serum potas sium levels spironolactone group 
even though severe hyperkalemia noted two subjects end study likely driven high initial level serum potassium level 
note patients ckd associated high risk hyper kalemia 
furthermore acei also increase serum potassium levels 
sug gest caution exercised prescribing spironolactone diabetes patients serum potas sium upper end normal range concomitant conditions receiving treatments adversely increase potassium levels 
besides hyper kalemia observe somnolence asthenia one patient spironolactone group end trial 
study mostly limited small sample size limiting ability generate stable estimates perform post hoc subgroups analyses 
adequately powered trials extended follow needed draw definitive conclusions 
indeed since hypertension chronic disease benefit low dose spironolac tone long term treatment resistant hypertension still needs demonstrated 
conclusions trial shown low dose mg spirono lactone add therapy resistant hypertension among black africans dm associated significant reduction office self measured bp optimal levels month treatment without affecting sodium level mild elevation serum potassium
