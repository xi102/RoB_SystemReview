substituted carbohydrates unsaturated fats sat urated fats consistently shown increase ldl cho lesterol 
previously showed limitation carbohydrate intake increase ldl cholesterol induced saturated fat due primarily large cholesterol rich ldl particles small dense ldl particles 
indeed present study found reduction ldl cholesterol dash diet compared control diet occurred conjunction lower concentrations large ldl particles well idl particles contribute cholesterol content standard ldl cholesterol measurement 
however despite energy higher saturated fat content hf dash diet compared dash diet sig nificant differences ldl cholesterol ldl subclasses diets 
may features dash diet mitigate increase ldl cholesterol typically observed higher saturated fat intake 
interest signi cantly higher ldl peak particle diameter hf dash diet compared dash diet 
although difference relatively small magnitude corresponded trend albeit nonsigni cant relatively higher concentrations larger ldl particles lower concentrations smaller ldl particles hf dash diet net difference total ldl particle concentrations 
change distribution ldl particles may easily detected peak diameter individual subfractions 
shift toward larger ldl particles hf dash diet may attributed least part lower carbohydrate content diet compared dash diet shift smaller larger ldl particles previously shown correlate reductions plasma triglyceride vldl concentrations resulting reduced carbohydrate sugar intake 
reductions triglycerides vldl par ticle concentrations hf dash diet compared dash diet observed present study relatively modest might expected moderate difference carbo hydrate content diets compared energy 
possible differences suf cient magnitude elicit signi cant reductions small dense ldl particles well apob index ldl particle number observed previously substantial ductions carbohydrate intake

changes observed hf dash diet al though differences effects hf dash dash diets reach signi cance 
basis duction hdl cholesterol dash diet known although noteworthy effect associated change hdl particle concentrations suggesting may represent change hdl composition 
investigators also tested modi cations dash diet bp lipid risk factors 
omniheart trial tested replacement energy carbohydrate dash diet energy unsaturated primarily monounsaturated fat energy protein 
protein mono unsaturated fat diets yielded similar greater reductions bp compared standard high carbohydrate dash diet 
replacing carbohydrate monounsaturated fat reduced total cholesterol triglycerides increased hdl cholesterol without affecting ldl cholesterol 
replacing carbohydrate protein reduced total ldl hdl cholesterol triglycerides 
beef optimal lean diet study found inclusion lean beef low saturated fat dash like diet resulted comparable effects lipid lipoprotein mea sures compared standard dash diet 
recently showed dash style diet containing either lean pork chicken sh similarly reduced bp 
together results present study ndings provide evi dence aspects dash diet modi ed without compromising bene ts bp ldl cholesterol lowering offering exibility food choices individuals following dash diet 
crossover design trial largely successful lipids lipoprotein returned baseline concentrations signi cant sequence effects carry forward effects variables 
exceptions clinic measurements systolic diastolic bps whose reductions showed signi cant carry forward hf dash diet un expected unexplained effect carry forward effect home bp measurements 
strengths study include high dietary compliance measured urinary biomarkers lack weight change potential confounder 
limitations include relatively small sample size short intervention duration 
conclusion results study indicate modi cation dash diet allow liberal total saturated fat intake conjunction moderate limitation carbohydrate intake primarily fruit juices sugars sults lower concentrations triglycerides vldl particles increases total ldl cholesterol attenuation favorable bp response standard dash diet 
therefore modi ed hf dash diet studied presents effective alternative widely recommended dietary pattern less stringent dietary fat constraints may promote even broader implementation
